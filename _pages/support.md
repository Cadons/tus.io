# Support

Since tus is developed in the open, _free community support_ is available through our public channels as listed below. The community support covers questions about the protocol itself and our open-source implementations. If you want advanced help with your own tus setup or would like private assistance, you can also pick the _commercial support_ from [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com/).

## Join the community

Are you as passionate about better file uploading as we are? Join us! We welcome all
contributions, be it in the form of patches, comments or questions. You can reach the community using many different channels:

- On [GitHub](https://github.com/tus), where the specification and all the code is hosted.
- On [Discourse](https://community.transloadit.com/c/tus), our community forum (new! be one of the first to leave a message).
- On [Slack](https://slackin-xgybtegrsh.now.sh), where the community is available for a chat.
- On [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tus_io), where the core developers sometimes tweet about the project.
- Additionally, the project lead can also be reached directly in person:
  - Marius: [marius@transloadit.com](mailto:marius@transloadit.com)

## Commercial support

The development of tus is sponsored by [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com/), a cloud service provider for file uploading, conversion and processing. Through their enterprise plan, they also offer commercial support for tus to help you with setup, integration, deployment, scaling and monitoring to cover your individual needs. If you are interested, feel free to contact them at [support@transloadit.com](mailto:support@transloadit.com).
