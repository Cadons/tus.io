## About tus

The internet is facing a problem. As camera quality on mobile devices continues to steadily improve,
user generated files grow larger and larger. Unfortunately this means that
uploading these files reliably becomes much harder as well, especially when using the tiny
mobile tubes provided by greedy network operators. The problem is that most
applications are not up to the challenge, which means that millions of cat images
and videos are lost due to network errors each year!

The tus.io project is here to stop this tragedy! tus is a [resumable
upload protocol](protocols/resumable-upload.html), with client and server
[implementations](implementations.html) for all platforms!
