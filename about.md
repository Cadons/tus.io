## About

The internet has a problem. Devices are getting better cameras, so user
generated files are getting bigger and bigger. Unfortunately this makes
uploading them reliably much harder as well, especially when using the tiny
mobile tubes provided by greedy network operators. The problem is that most
applications are not up to the challenge, meaning that millions of cat images
and videos are lost due to network errors every year!

The tus.io project is here to change this! We are working on a [resumable
upload protocol](protocols/resumable-upload.html), along with client and server
[implementations](implementations.html) for all platforms!
