## About

The Core Team currently consists of the founders of Transloadit,
a small bootstrapped company from Berlin and Amsterdam.
For over 4 years now, it has been our mission to solve all file related worries
you may experience when building an application.

We were one of the first users and big contributors to
[node.js](http://nodejs.org/), created the most popular [module for
parsing file uploads](http://github.com/felixge/node-formidable), and have
built a successful product on top of both:
[transloadit.com](http://transloadit.com/).

This time, we're trying to take things one step further, creating
file processing projects that are 100% open source and a home to an active
community!
