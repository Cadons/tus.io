The tus project is split into several repositories:

* [tusd](https://github.com/tus/tusd) - A dedicated upload server written in Go.
* [tus-html5-client](https://github.com/tus/tus-html5-client) - The client for HTML apps.
* [tus-ios-client](https://github.com/tus/tus-ios-client) - The client for iOS apps.
* [tus-android-client](https://github.com/tus/tus-android-client) - The client for Android apps.
* [tus.io](https://github.com/tus/tus.io) - The tus.io website itself.

At first, we will focus on the tusd server and the HTML5 client in order to nail
the protocol and basic feature set. However, the iOS and Android clients will
follow quickly and be treated as first class citizens.
