Every project builds its own file uploader. A thousand one week projects that barely work, when all we need is one real project, done right.\r\n\r\nWe are going to do this right. We will solve reliable file uploads for once and for all. A new open protocol for resumable uploads (Tus) built on HTTP. Simple, cheap, reusable stacks for clients and servers. Any language, any platform, any network.\r\n\r\nIt's probably an impossible dream. No-one has managed yet. But we're going to give it our best shot. Join us on GitHub and help us make the world a better place. No more lost cat videos!\r\n"

Your numbers look like 100 MBit/sec is indeed doable for Chrome/FF, so that's really exciting!\r\n\r\nAs far as simpler digest goes: I'm not sure what your requirements are. For example we only have to be able to determine a reasonably unique fingerprint for files selected via a file input element. This fingerprint needs to be unique for the machine/browser it is generated on, but doesn't have to be unique enough to do server-side de-duplication. This probably means our current approach (file name + size + modified date + etc.) is good enough for our use case, but not suitable for what you're trying to do?\r\n\r\n"

I understand that chunked transfer encoding is great when you don't know the size beforehand but going as far as making a non-identity transfer-encoding and *Content-Length* header mutually exclusive is just silly (but I'm sure they must have had their reasons...).\r\n\r\nFor instance, on Droplr the server is currently violating that rule as I always need to know the size of the file before allowing the upload (user may have no more space, file may be too large for the free accounts, etc). It was either that or not supporting chunked transfer encoding at all. Since this is to become a more widely used standard you'll need a more elegant solution."

    "body": "@awendt thank you so much for this feedback, these are good points indeed!\r\n\r\nRegarding the `Range` header, [section 14.35](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.16) starts out by saying:\r\n\r\n> Since all HTTP entities are represented in HTTP messages as sequences of bytes, the concept of a byte range is meaningful for any HTTP entity.\r\n\r\nThis makes me think that the `Range` header is also allowed for responses. At least I could not find anything in the spec that says it's forbidden. Using `Range` for the responses is mainly desirable as it allows for multiple ranges to be returned, giving clients the ability to upload parts of a file in parallel as well as out of order (not part of the protocol yet, but will be added soon). Additionally the [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/using_resumable_upload_protocol#Handle_Response_to_Status_Request) serves as prior art for using the `Range` header this way and gives me reason to believe this will work well with existing http clients and libraries.\r\n\r\n> Why do you use \"Range\" for the response and \"Content-Range\" for the request?\r\n\r\nIt's a simular situation as for the `Range` header, the http spec has no example of using it for a request, but it seems to be the right choice given the `Content-Range` header [definition](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.16):\r\n\r\n> The Content-Range entity-header is sent with a partial entity-body to specify where in the full entity-body the partial body should be applied. Range units are defined in section 3.12.\r\n\r\nI actually think that the http specification generally does not distinguish between request/response headers, and many headers make sense for both (e.g. `Content-Length`).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?"

It's not saying the range header can apply to both message types (request messages and response messages). An entity is the payload of a message - they're not the same thing.\r\n\r\nIf you look at [the ABNF grammar for a response](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec6.html#sec6), you'll see that [request-headers](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html#sec5.3) are clearly not permitted there. If Range was meant to be applicable to both request and response messages, it would have been included in the [entity-header](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec7.html#sec7.1) set.\r\n\r\n> I actually think that the http specification generally does not distinguish between request/response headers, and many headers make sense for both (e.g. Content-Length).\r\n\r\nThe headers that apply to both are either [general-headers](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.5) or [entity-headers](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec7.html#sec7.1)."

It's a complex subject, but for anybody who is interested:\r\n\r\n* [J. Stone et. al., \"Performance of Checksums and CRC's over Real Data\" 1998](ftp://ftp.cis.upenn.edu/pub/mbgreen/papers/ton98.pdf) looks at the checksum algorithm used by TCP and compares it with CRC\r\n* [RFC3385 Internet Protocol Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)/Checksum Considerations](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3385) compares CRC to alternative checksums (but not the one used by TCP)\r\n\r\nThe tl;dr; is: TCP checksums are quite weak by modern standards, but layer 2 technologies such as Ethernet/Wifi/PPP have their own CRC checksums and will drop bad frames which TCP will detect and retransmit. So in order for a TCP frame with corrupted data to reach our BSD sockets, it will require both the weak and the stronger mechanism to fail at the same time - which should be quite rare. (unfortunately I don't have time to quantify \"quite rare\" further, it would be quite a little math side project).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nFelix"

    "body": "Working on a \"contractual exchange of high value assets\" system (~ $50 * 10**12/year) we did the maths and figured worst case noisy lines you might see a 2+-bit error (all single bit errors will be caught by the TCP checksum) once in 10**12 bytes (1 terabyte transferred) on a raw socket, so we added an extra 32-bit checksum per binary message (~100-1000 bytes, multiple messages per TCP packet, and they can cross packet boundaries).\r\n\r\nWe figured this pushed the error rate out to something close to 10**40 which is my unofficial \"ain't never gonna happen\" figure (c.f. age of the universe in seconds ~ 10**17).\r\n\r\nOh and then we added IPSec (ESP+AH) to the parts of the network we controlled and SSL to the entire end-to-end comms, and as you note, the checksums from other layers work too and they will each tend to catch bad data, but with big money changing hands we really didn't want to take chances.\r\n"
