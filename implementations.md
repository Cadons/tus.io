## {{page.title}}

Here are some real-life code examples of languages implementing the tus resumable upload protocol.

### Official

These projects are reference implementations maintained by the protocol developers.
Later on, we want to adopt high-quality MIT licensed implementations for all languages and platforms
under the tus organisations. We'll be looking for gems inside the community section for that.

#### Server

- [tus-jquery-client](https://github.com/tus/tus-jquery-client)
Add resumable file uploads to web apps that are built with jQuery
by tus core
licensed under MIT

#### Client

- [tusd](https://github.com/tus/tusd)
A stand-alone server written in Go to handle resumable file uploads using the tus protocol
by tus core
licensed under MIT

### Community

The tus protocol is very simple and because it builds on standard HTTP calls it
could be implemented as Ruby libraries, Wordpress plugins, Bash/cURL, etc.

Drop a line if you built an open source tus implementation, and you'll be
listed here.

For new implementations we recommend using the MIT license and making clear
what protocol version you're targetting.
