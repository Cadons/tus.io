### Server-side

- [tusd](https://github.com/tus/tusd)
A stand-alone server written in go to handle resumable file uploads
using the tus protocol

### In the wild

The tus protocol is very simple and because it builds on standard HTTP calls it
could be implemented as Ruby libraries, Wordpress plugins, Bash/cURL, etc.

The tus organisation on Github can provide a home for many more implementations
than we're currently trying to push out. Feel free to help out!

Drop a line if you built an open source tus implementation, and you'll be
listed here. If the work is battletested and you're an active maintainer,
your implementation could become the official one for your language/platform.

For implementations we recommend using the MIT license.
