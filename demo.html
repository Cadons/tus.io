<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>

<p>This demo is a proof of concept for resumable file uploads.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Select a large file.</li>
  <li>Watch it upload for a bit, then close this tab before it finishes.</li>
  <li>Come back to the tab, select the same file again, the upload should resume where it left off.</li>
</ol>

<form id="js_upload">
  <input class="js_file" name="upload" type="file" />
</form>

<div class="progress progress-striped active">
  <div class="bar js_progress"></div>
</div>

<a class="btn btn-success download js_download">Download</a>

  <li>Firefox 19.0.2 on OS 10.8.2 (working)</li>
  <li>Opera 12.12 on OS X 10.8.3 (working)</li>
</ul>
