features:
- title: HTTP-based
  content: |
    Built as a layer on top of the popular HTTP protocol, tus can be easily integrated
    into applications using existing libraries, proxies, and firewalls, and can
    be used directly from any website.
- title: Production-ready
  content: |
    tus can be considered ready for use in production and has completed numerous
    rounds of improvements and feedback from people working at Vimeo, Google
    and multiple other known companies.
- title: Open source
  content: |
    The source code to all of our implementations, this website and even the protocol
    itself is accessible to everyone under MIT license, right from our
    [GitHub](https://github.com/tus) organization.
- title: Minimalistic design...
  content: |
    The specification only requires a very small set of features to be
    implemented by clients and servers, embracing simplicity and fast
    development and iteration speed for everyone.
- title: ... and still extensible
  content: |
    tus still features an extensive list of extensions introducing additional
    functionality, including parallel uploading, checksums and expiration,
    which can be implemented voluntarily.
- title: Community-owned
  content: |
    We believe in an open and accessible evolution of this protocol. At any
    stage and since the beginning of tus, feedback has been appreciated and
    integrated. Your contributions are awaited.
