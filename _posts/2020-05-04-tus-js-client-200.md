Since tus-js-client had been born five years ago, it has grown a lot in numbers of features and supported environments. While it was originally designed for browsers, it it not also able to be used in Node.js, React Native and Apache Cordova applications. However, over the time this growth has also introduces some technical debt that hinders further development. In this release, we cleaned up the code base, remove some odd API decisions from early on and also add long awaited features.

## Breaking changes

The main behavior of tus-js-client and the vast majority of its API stay the same. However, following breaking changes were necessary:

- **Drop support for Node.js 6 and 7:** Only Node.js 8 oder newer are fully supported and tested for compatibility with tus-js-client from now own. Earlier versions may work but we don't guarantee it. Note that we still support the same browsers as before.
-  **Require support for Promises:** The internal code has been partially rewritten to use Promises instead of callbacks, which allowed us to clean up a lot of old spaghetti code. For library users this means that you need to use a *Promise polyfill* if your application runs in older browsers which do not support Promises. Have a look at [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/#feat=promises) for a list of those browsers and [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js#ecmascript-promise) for poylfilling.
- **Use Promises for `abort`/`terminate` functions:** The `Upload#abort` and `Upload.terminate` function do not longer accept a callback but instead return a Promise now. We recommend adding a catch phrase to avoid errors about unhandled rejections. If you have code such as:
	```js
	upload.abort(true, function(err) {
	   if(err) // Handle error
	   else // Handle successful abort call
	});
	```
	you should rewrite it to:
	```js
	upload.abort(true).then(function() {
	   // Handle success
	}).catch(function(err) {
	   // Handle error
	});
	```
- **Use Promises for `fingerprint` option:** The function that is passed as the `fingerprint` option into the `Upload`-constructor is not callback-based anymore. Instead it must also return a Promise. If you supply a custom fingerprint function it must have a signature such as:
	```js
	function fingerprint(file, options) {
	  const result = ....
	  return Promise.resolve(result);
	});
	```
- **Enable retries by default:** tus-js-client has supported automated retries of network-caused error for years using the `retryDelays` option. However, in order to avoid breaking changes, this feature had been disabled by default when it was introduced. With this release, the retrying mechanism will be enabled by default to make it easier for new users to take advantage of it. If you have custom retrying code implemented, you may want to check that it is compatible when tus-js-client also retries HTTP requests.
- **Remove `resume` option:** Historically, the `resume` option has controlled whether tus-js-client will check if it capable of resuming an upload from a previous browsing session (e.g. when the browser has accidentally been closed while the upload was still running). This was implemented by calculating the fingerprint for the given input file and comparing it to a list of previously created upload which was stored in the browser's `localStorage`. If such an upload exists, tus-js-client would attempt to resume it.
However, this effectively gives the application no control over which upload is resumed. In previous versions applications were not able to retrieve the list of previously created uploads or remove items from this list. Furthermore, if multiple matching uploads were found for a fingerprint, the applications could not decide which of those uploads should be resumed.
In this release, the `resume` option has been removed and instead the Upload Storage API has been added. An introduction into the Upload Storage API can be found in the section below describing the new features. If you previously did not explicitly set `resume: false`, you can get the previous behavior using following code snippet:
	```js
	upload = new tus.Upload(file, options);
	upload.findPreviousUploads().then((previousUploads) => {
	  if (previousUploads.length > 0) {
	     upload.resumeFromPreviousUpload(previousUploads[0]);
	  }

	  upload.start();
	});
	```
- **Remove `withCredentials` option:** This release introduces a HTTP abstraction layer to overcome differences between network APIs in browsers and inside Node.js. This makes internal code a lot more cleaner but also means that the browser-only `withCredentials` option is not properly possible anymore. If you used this feature before, you can now explicitly set this flag using the request callbacks:
	```js
	upload = new tus.Upload(file, {
	   endpoint: '...',
	   onBeforeRequestSend: (req) => {
	      const xhr = req.getUnderlyingObject();
	      xhr.withCredentials = true;
	   },
	   ...
	});
	```

## New features

Besides cleaning up old technical debt, this release also introduces new functionality:

- **Add Upload Storage API:**
- **Add HTTP abstraction layer:**
- **Add File Reader abstraction layer:**
- **Add support for Parallel Uploads:**
- **Add request IDs:**
- **Add request and response callbacks:**
