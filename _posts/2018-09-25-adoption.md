Just a quick update from the team : )
 
We had a fun month as we learned that [Git LFS supports our protocol for transmitting large files](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/docs/man/git-lfs-config.5.ronn#transfer-upload--download-settings), and Clouflare uses it to power the uploading component of their [new streaming product](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-streams/). The community on GitHub continues to thrive and we're seeing issues raised and addressed on a daily basis.

Tus was also featured in a magazine: Streaming Media. They asked for supporting graphic material, so we asked our designer [Alexander Zaytsev](https://twitter.com/nqst) to explain the Concat Extension in a visual way, and he came up with the following:

<img style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%" src="/assets/img/concat.jpeg">

Which we thought was really cool but we'd love to hear what _you_ think.

All the best from the team at [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com) and see you on Slack/GitHub!
